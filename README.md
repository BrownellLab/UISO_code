========================================================

This repository contains all of the code necessary to analyze and produce figures for the publication.

All other dependencies can be found in:

```
config/global.cfg
```

First, set your working directory to the root of the respository (where the README.md is). Then, to run everything (WARNING: some things require a lot of memory).

```{r}
library(ProjectTemplate)
load.project()
```
